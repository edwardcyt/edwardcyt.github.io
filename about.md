Hey, my name is Edward Tsai

I am a data analytics professional currently working for Facebook based in Menlo Park, CA. 

I was born and raised in Taipei, Taiwan. With an undergraduate major in operations reasearch from National Taiwan University, I came to US for graduate degree in supply chain management. 

After graduated, I spent first half of my career in supply chain management field for companies like Panasonic and Bayer. About 3 years ago, I realized I really enjoy doing data analysis through more sophisticated statistical analysis, machine learning and data visualization to make impact. 

Outside of work, I enjoy going to the gym, playing tennis, going to live music, and play guitar. I also like to travel and I have been to more than 20 countries and hopefully, more to come.

Thanks for reading!
